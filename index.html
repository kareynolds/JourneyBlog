        below it or 3x3 however many needed. it will show the languages
        and skills i hope to learn as i progress. The highlighted one will be 
        the language in progress, the ones leanred should have some type of unified
        color. The ones planning to learn in grey. THere should be a descriptoin within
        the p tag that goes over we're all life long learners, while my knowledge certainly 
        has gaps I have gained competency and comfortability in the following languages
        highlighted in green. Yellow is in progress, grey are on deck!
