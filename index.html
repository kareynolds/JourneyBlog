                My name is Andy Reynolds, and I'm an addict. Fortunately my addiction is relatively healthy
                and extends solely to the pursuit of programming knowledge. Cruise around this site
                and eventually you'll agree. Click on the archived story link above to see my 
                humble beginnings through learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and beyond. The link 
                below will take you to what I'm currently studying and working on.
                My about page, socials and github are located in the banner.

        <!-- Here will go boxes in a 2 x 2 grid, with another 2 x 2 grid
        below it or 3x3 however many needed. it will show the languages
        and skills i hope to learn as i progress. The highlighted one will be 
        the language in progress, the ones leanred should have some type of unified
        color. The ones planning to learn in grey. THere should be a descriptoin within
        the p tag that goes over we're all life long learners, while my knowledge certainly 
        has gaps I have gained competency and comfortability in the following languages
        highlighted in green. Yellow is in progress, grey are on deck!
