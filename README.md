The purpose of this blog will be to document my journey, re-learning to code to some extent, expanding upon that knowledge and showcasing what I've learned as I progress through The Odin Project and beyond.

The blog will be periodically updated, ideally weekly but possibly more or less frequently as learning milestones occur and time permits. 

The main page will have a brief bio, description, an about me page that details my life and what I've seen / done in it. Qualifications, if you will. 
The main page will also have links to each blog post, still debating whether I want the link title to be the concept learned, the week etc. Maybe a combination of each. 

When clicking on a link to a blog post / update the goal behind the blog post will be to describe what was learned, my take away and to show or provide a demonstration of this within the blog page itself. What may make the most sense is embedded images within the web page to show examples of what is being worked on, though this idea is a work in progress. either way the goal is to explain what was learned, my take away, and show how it was applied. 

Through doing this I will be learning, applying, and explaining / teaching which in my experience is the best way to cement knowledge. 

** Theme & Feel **
Feel - I would like the way this reads to be light, not so matter of fact, but more so it should be easy to read, entertaining to some extent. I speak often with humor, albeit dry at times, so i intend to inject that into this. Ideally if someone is considering me for a job they'll see that I'm not a robot. i intend to have that reflect in my writing style. 

Theme - Each archived post should show, through the post itself, the code and how the blog post itself is presented, how I'm progressing. The later stages are likely going to take far more work, but such as it is. This may cause the updates to be slower. I want the read to see the imapct of my learnings and feel it with each update.
